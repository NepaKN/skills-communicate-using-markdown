# The Markdown experience!
###### *writing headings and adding content to the markdown*
##### This is my first experience using Github, while I am learning to communicate with Markdown. A new, yet exciting experience for me, as I write here. Things happen as expected, unexpected occurrences I see at times.
##### This is how it is, nothing happens the way we want, yet we live on the edge as we go through new experiences. 
###### A big thanks to GPS who helped me get here. Being a torch on this path. Thanks!

In this learning process, here I am practicing how to include the **codes** in the markdown
```
$ git init
Initialize empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
